\section{Education}
{\bf Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute}, Troy, NY \hfill Graduating December, 2016 \\
B.S., Computer Science, Minor in Physics \\
GPA: 3.77

\section{Courses}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
$\bullet$ Natural Language Processing & $\bullet$ Programming Languages & $\bullet$ Computer Graphics \\
$\bullet$ Computer Organization \& Design & $\bullet$ Algorithms & $\bullet$ Data Structures \\

\section{Professional Experience}
{\bf Software Engineer Intern,} \uline{LinkedIn} \hfill Summer 2015
 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt % reduce space between items
 \item Implemented mini-profiles for LinkedIn's homepage using the Play Framework in Scala and Dust.js.
 \end{itemize}



{\bf Software Engineer Intern,} \uline{Intentional Software} \hfill Spring 2015
 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt % reduce space between items
 \item Designed and developed a natural user interface using the Microsoft Kinect to implement a gesture and virtual touch screen interface.
 \item Wrote a hand pose classifier in C++ using feature matching in OpenCV.
 \item Developed an N-dimensional implementation in C++ of UW's \$1 Recognizer for atomic gesture recognition with the Kinect. % TODO: add link to UW's $1 Recognizer
 \item Architected a data transformation pipeline for processing input from motion sensing devices such as the Kinect, Leap Motion, and Myo.
 \end{itemize}



{\bf Software Engineer Intern,} \uline{Bloomberg L.P.} \hfill Summer 2014
 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
 \item Developed an analytic tool using C++ and service-oriented architecture on the back end to expose data from an SQLite database.
 \item Designed and developed the tool's front end application as a Bloomberg Terminal function in javascript to allow the user to view and modify data in the database.
 \item My tool was used to quickly fix a fatal error in the way market data from exchanges were stored. Similar errors previously took many hours to fix without my tool.
 \end{itemize}



{\bf Software Engineer \& \\ Physics Consultant,} \uline{Mimir Physics} \hfill Summer 2012 -- 2013
 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt  % reduce space between items
 \item Co-author of a patent (pending application) for a hardware and software solution to account for variations in the spectra of multiple light sources in imaging applications.
 \item Developed an image processor in C++ for high color bit depth images that analyzed color data to create color images with an absolute color error of $\Delta E^* < 1$.
 \item Designed and prototyped custom hardware with an FTDI USB interface  and developed software to interface with it.
 \item Increased the processing speed by a factor of nearly 100.
 \end{itemize}

\section{Other \\ Projects}
\begin{description}
	\item[MyoIntelligesture] -- \uline{\href{http://GitHub.com/VoidingWarranties/Myo-Intelligesture}{GitHub.com/VoidingWarranties/Myo-Intelligesture}} \\
		A library for processing raw data from the Thalmic Myo using a non-linear data pipeline.
	\item[MyoHome] -- \uline{\href{http://GitHub.com/VoidingWarranties/Myo-Home}{GitHub.com/VoidingWarranties/Myo-Home}} \\
		A natural user interface for home automation using the Thalmic Myo. Allows you to control home appliances by pointing at them and gesturing. Heavily uses MyoIntelligesture.
	\item[SignSight] -- \uline{\href{http://GitHub.com/VoidingWarranties/SignSight}{GitHub.com/VoidingWarranties/SignSight}} \\
		A unique computer vision approach to automatic traffic sign recognition.
