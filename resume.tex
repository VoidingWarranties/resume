\section{Professional Experience}
{\bf Software Engineer,} Bloomberg L.P., New York, NY \hfill Summer 2014
 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
 \item Worked on a large team to develop a relational database to store metadata and metadata history for large amounts of financial data.
 \item Developed an API and service in C++ to expose useful data from this database.
 \item Independently designed and developed a UI, which utilized this service, for our internal business teams. \\
 \end{itemize}



{\bf Software Engineer \& \\ Physics Consultant,} Mimir Physics, Westbrook, ME \hfill Summers 2012-13
 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt  % reduce space between items
 \item Worked on a team of two to develop an efficient image processor in C and C++ for high resolution and high color bit depth images. %that analyzed color data to create color images with a color error of $\Delta E^* < 1$.
 \item Created an application and user interface in Visual Basic which interfaced with custom camera hardware to create color images with a color error of $\Delta E^* < 1$. %visually analyze the color using the image processor we developed.
 \item Designed and prototyped custom hardware with an FTDI USB interface  and developed software to interface with it.
 \item My contributions were directly responsible for the success of the project. The processing speed was increased by 740\% and was finished ahead of schedule. \\
 \end{itemize}

 
 
{\bf Software Engineer,} Fairchild Semiconductor, South Portland, ME \hfill  Summer 2011
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt %reduce space between items
 \item Reduced time and money spent on repetitive quality assurance tasks by developing programs in Perl and Bash to automate these tasks.
 \item Consolidated the work of collecting the results of quality assurance analyses from the many company locations around the world by creating a utility that utilized SSH tunnels to collect the results.
\end{itemize}
