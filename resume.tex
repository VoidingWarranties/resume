{\bf Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute}, Troy, NY \hfill Graduating May, 2016 \\
B.S., Computer Science, Minor in Physics \\
GPA: 3.76
 

\section{Professional Experience}
{\bf Software Engineering Intern,} \uline{Bloomberg L.P.} \hfill Summer 2014
 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
 \item Developed an analytic tool to help the business teams better understand how external market data is provided to clients by leveraging field overload definitions.
 \item Developed the tool's back end using C++ and service-oriented architecture to expose metadata of overloaded field mappings from a SQLite database.
 \item Designed the front end application in javascript to allow the user to view and modify field overload definitions in the database.
 \end{itemize}



{\bf Software Engineer \& \\ Physics Consultant,} \uline{Mimir Physics} \hfill 2012-13
 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt  % reduce space between items
 \item Co-author of a patent (pending application) for a hardware and software solution to account for variations in the spectra of multiple light sources in imaging applications.
 \item Developed an image processor in C++ for high color bit depth images that analyzed color data to create color images with an absolute color error of $\Delta E^* < 1$.
 \item Designed and prototyped custom hardware with an FTDI USB interface  and developed software to interface with it.
 \item Increased the processing speed by a factor of nearly 100.
 \end{itemize}

 
 
{\bf Software Engineering Intern,} \uline{Fairchild Semiconductor} \hfill  Summer 2011
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt %reduce space between items
 \item Developed tools to automate quality assurance analyses, collate the data, and then distribute the results across the company's internal network.
 \item Provided a UI for the tools that was written in Perl using the Tk framework.
\end{itemize}
