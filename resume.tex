\section{Education} 
{\bf Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute}, Troy, NY \hfill Graduating May, 2016 \\
B.S., Computer Science, Minor in Physics \\
GPA: 3.76
 

\section{Professional Experience}
{\bf Software Engineer,} \uline{Bloomberg L.P.}, New York, NY \hfill Summer 2014
 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
 \item Developed an analytic tool to help the business teams better understand how external market data is provided to clients by leveraging field overload definitions.
 \item Developed the tool's back end using service-oriented architecture (SOA) to expose metadata of overloaded field mappings from a relational database.
 \item Designed the front end application which utilizes this SOA to allow the user to view and modify field overload definitions.
 \end{itemize}



{\bf Software Engineer \& \\ Physics Consultant,} \uline{Mimir Physics}, Westbrook, ME \hfill Summers 2012-13
 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt  % reduce space between items
 \item Co-author of a (pending) patent for a hardware and software solution to account for variations in the spectra of multiple light sources in imaging applications.
 \item Developed an efficient image processor for high color bit depth images that analyzed color data to create color images with an absolute color error of $\Delta E^* < 1$.
 \item Designed and prototyped custom hardware with an FTDI USB interface  and developed software to interface with it.
 \item Increased the processing speed by a factor of nearly 100.
 \end{itemize}

 
 
{\bf Software Engineer,} \uline{Fairchild Semiconductor}, South Portland, ME \hfill  Summer 2011
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt %reduce space between items
 \item Developed tools to automate quality assurance analyses, collate the data, and then distribute the results across the company's internal network.
 \item Provided a UI for the tools that was written in Perl using the Tk framework.
\end{itemize}
